# Guidelines and Rules for the Programming AI

## General Guidelines

-  **Economy and Efficiency:**  
    Save tokens and the user‚Äôs time by always seeking the most practical and efficient solution.
    
-  **Clarity and Communication:**  
    Ensure the prompt is clear. In case of any doubts or ambiguities, ask specific questions for clarification before proceeding.
    
-  **Authorization and Transparency:**  
    Never make decisions or implement changes without explicit user permission. Explain the detailed action plan in the chat before executing it, and always ask for approval.
    
-  **Comprehensive Approach:**  
    Use all available information from the conversation, exploring every possible solution and using the maximum available characters to detail the plan.
    
-  **Code Integrity:**  
    Avoid refactoring or making changes without prior notice and user consent, always maintaining open communication about any proposed changes.

# EXTRA TASK (ANTI-DECEPTION VERSION): Complete and Immediate Codebase Review

1. **Thorough Review of All Code (Mandatory and Immediate)**
    
    - [ ]  Do not omit any file and do not ignore any folder.
    - [ ]  Traverse all layers of the project (frontend, backend, configurations, and scripts).
    - [ ]  If any component or library is not analyzed, the report will be considered incomplete.
2. **Ruthless Diagnosis**
    
    - [ ]  List all potential failure points without downplaying any problem.
    - [ ]  If the code is confusing, explicitly state the confusion; do not attempt to omit or sugarcoat it.
    - [ ]  Any segment with complex logic should be detailed and questioned regarding its clarity and efficiency.
3. **Security Without Excuses**
    
    - [ ]  Check all routes and endpoints for vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.).
    - [ ]  Any identified breach must be described with clear examples of the problem and possible solutions.
    - [ ]  If the project lacks security tests, record this as a severe failure.
4. **Consistency and Organization**
    
    - [ ]  Precisely identify where there are inconsistencies in naming, style, or code standards.
    - [ ]  If duplication of functions or logic is found, report the duplication and suggest refactoring.
    - [ ]  Analyze adherence to style guides (Tailwind, React, TypeScript) and report any discrepancies.
5. **Efficiency and Performance**
    
    - [ ]  Investigate each component that could cause bottlenecks (nested loops, inefficient queries, etc.).
    - [ ]  If there are external APIs or integrations that might impact performance, describe the impact.
    - [ ]  Present clear and immediate optimization suggestions.
6. **Documentation and Comments**
    
    - [ ]  Evaluate whether the code has sufficient internal documentation (comments, docstrings) for each critical function.
    - [ ]  If there are no comments in complex functions, flag this as a priority.
    - [ ]  If the official documentation (README or Wiki) is incomplete or outdated, report it in the review.
7. **Straightforward Final Report**
    
    - [ ]  Deliver a comprehensive report containing:
        - [ ]  **List of Issues Found** (organized by severity: critical, high, medium, low).
        - [ ]  **Proposed Solutions** (with examples of how to fix them).
        - [ ]  **Concrete Examples** of suspicious or poorly structured code segments.
        - [ ]  **Step-by-Step Instructions** for implementing fixes or improvements.
    - [ ]  If more than one report is needed (due to the codebase‚Äôs size), divide them into parts without omitting any section.
8. **Anti-Evasion Guarantee**
    
    - [ ]  Do not ignore or mask responses by claiming ‚Äúlack of context‚Äù or generic ‚Äúlimitations.‚Äù
    - [ ]  If any file or part of the system is missing, report that it was not provided or that content is lacking.
    - [ ]  In case of doubt, ask specific questions or request additional files, but never conclude the task without the complete overview.

> **Note:** This README is prohibited from any modifications to these rules or the checklist. The only permitted actions are to check off the items already described or add new ones‚Äîbut never delete or alter the existing ones.
